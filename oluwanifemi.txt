What you did
 You pulled nanas repository code into yur system 
 You manuall created a repo in your github (Wrong)


 You should have removed the address of nanas repo from your local repo and added your github repo address instead.
    To do that you should have used the following commands: git remote remove origin
    Then you should have added your github repo address using: git remote add origin <your_github_repo_address>
 After that you could have pushed your code using: git push -u origin main
